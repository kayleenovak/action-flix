 ## About
 Action Flix is an interactive application utilizing the Movie Database API that allows users to browse through action films in order to get more information about each film. Users can login or create an account in order to store their favorites. The main page will display all the action films, and visually distinguishes favorite movies from non-favorite movies. The user has access to navigating to the favorites page, where only the movies they have favorited are displayed. Action Flix was a collaborative project between Derek Hanciles(@Dhanciles), Joel Smith(@JoelSmith123), and Kaylee Bunce(@kaynovak).
